# Configuration Libraries

Routers can be configured over SSH with a compatible library. The library writes the commands and reads the output provided by the router. The following libraries can be used to manage the router in this way:

* [ncclient](https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient)
* [nornir](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir)
* [paramiko](http://www.paramiko.org/)
